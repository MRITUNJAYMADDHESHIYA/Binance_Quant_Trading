1->Speed is Everything:-

Retail setup (home + REST polling): ~200–500 ms. 
Retail + WebSocket + VPS in Singapore: ~20–50 ms.
Professional HFT (co-located server, raw FIX API): <1 ms.

condition for me:-
Only execute if profit > fees + slippage + latency risk.
Don’t chase every cycle → focus on high-profit ones (>0.3%).

Optimize Code:-
Use async programming (Python asyncio) instead of sequential loops
Keep prices in memory (from WebSocket) instead of fetching repeatedly.
Minimize logging / printing inside your arbitrage loop.



2->Triangular Arbitrage:-

USDT->BTC->ETH->USDT

Example:-
Suppose you start with 1000 USDT:
Convert USDT → BTC
1 BTC = 50,000 USDT → You get 0.02 BTC.
Convert BTC → ETH
1 BTC = 15 ETH → You get 0.3 ETH.
Convert ETH → USDT
1 ETH = 3400 USDT → You get 1020 USDT.
Profit = 20 USDT (ignoring fees).


Step 1: Buy BTC with USDT (use ask price of BTC/USDT).
Step 2: Sell BTC for ETH (use bid price of ETH/BTC).
Step 3: Sell ETH for USDT (use bid price of ETH/USDT).

Profit % = (Final USDT - Initial USDT) / Initial USDT.
