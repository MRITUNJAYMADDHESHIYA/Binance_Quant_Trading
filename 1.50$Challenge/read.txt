#### I want to know at which point(not about time or price) market stable and volatile
1. I need bid and ask volume, for every 1m data(last 20 candle of bid and ask data)
2.1 using some mean of previous 20 candles-> stable and volatile
2.2 using soome machine learning method to find the stable and volatile market(AgglomerativeClustering, KMeans, e.t.c)



#### Different method to find the volatile and stable market then I am able to find that 2.1 method is more accurate for this.
3.if the current candle and previous candle is in volatile then next candle i am going to place an order.
4.buy-> bid > ask , sell-> ask > bid (simple is best)

5.I can change the tp and sl method depend on percentage related to account 
6. Bot is working 100% correct and that's it I need more time for accuracy, more efficient, stable also.
